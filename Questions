- In adventuregame, I was attempting to use a variable (hp) in a new function. When writing the funciton,
it says the variable is undefined even though the variable is before that function and i can use the variable as str(hp) in a different function. Why?


- Lots of issues with if, elif and else statements. Why arent elif functions working?
ex. Tried to add a open door elif in adventuregame.py in the instance that open the door is not entered.
When the code runs and open door is input it ignores it and runs the else statement insead.
